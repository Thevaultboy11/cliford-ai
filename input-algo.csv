While common business systems like ERP (Enterprise Resource Planning) or CRM (Customer Relationship Management) have digitalized wide parts of businesses and AI has taken center stage in the media supply chain, the management of production technology assets is still quite analog and fragmented, requiring manual data entry and monitoring from the workforce.

Noreja,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/noreja
"At Noreja we rethink process mining and place the business objects along the process at the center of attention. Therefore, we focus on target- and user-oriented visualizations which provide direct implications for action. A new way to conduct data integration combines domain knowledge of process experts with process data – An approach we call Causal Process Mining. Our software solution enables companies to leverage existing data from e.g., ERP, SCM, CRM, PLM or BPMS in order to transfer Business Process Management from subjective and time-consuming to data-driven and automated. Our solution differentiates itself from other offerings because it is tailored to avoid spaghetti-like diagrams. Instead, the focus is on the causal relationships between events and actionable insights that provide opportunities for process optimization. To this end, we provide a workflow-like procedure for analysts to identify anomalies and optimization potential – without the need to understand process modeling notations or process mining specialties. We also support management with business critical Process Performance Indicators and decision-supporting visualizations.",

Trumania: Evidence Social Cam App,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/trumania
"SHORT DESCRIPTION: Mobile application & website: TimeSTAMPED & independently verifiable PHOTOS and VIDEOS that can be used as an evidence of anything - b2b, b2c, b2b2c - in any industry. www.trumania.net WHAT IS DOES> Trumania App makes photos and videos, puts a timestamp on it containing an ID, date, time, and location. When you click ""save"" Trumania uploads your media file to its servers and since then, this file is an independent proof of what was taken on it and proof that no editing was applied.

TimeFlip,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/timeflip
"TimeFlip disrupts time and workflow management market with an ultimately simple and user friendly IoT solution. As founders of TimeFlip, we had a long experience in contracting and outsourcing all kinds of work: from software development to industrial design, video production, web design, content marketing, accounting, etc. We've seen a zoo of of time and workflow management software tools in use by our collaborators and tried many ourselves. Eventually, we were convinced: there was no universal solution on the market, something that would be super easy to use and adopt. Our idea was to create an ultimately simple and user friendly ""physical"" time tracker to replace 100+ existing mobile and desktop apps - all that claim too much of our energy and focus. This is how we came up with TimeFlip - an app-powered dodecahedron with a tiny accelerometer inside that can always tell which way it’s sitting and records the time. All you do to operate it is flip it around so the side corresponding to what you’re doing is up; the chip inside sends a signal over Bluetooth to an app on your phone. All types of activities/tasks can be tracked, for example: time spent per project/client/process or an activity or concrete work task (testing, reporting, accounting, etc). All collected time statistics is stored in the cloud, visualized in the app or web interface and is available for export. Activities or tasks may be prioritized or set billable (in desired currency) for invoicing. Traction: TimeFlip is already on the market and has found over 4500 clients worldwide as of Feb 2019. We have signed distribution agreements in USA, UAE and Russia and are preparing similar in France and Germany. TimeFlip is certified by CE, FCC and TRA and has registered own trademark. Plans: While the first version of TiemFlip was focusing more on B2C market, after collecting positive customer feedback we are building a PRO version that will suit best corporate markets and allow for easy integrations with 3rd party software. On top of that we are planning to build a strong ML-enabled data analytics system to actually advice people and teams on right productivity patterns in order to reach best performance. For that purpose we are currently looking for a next seed-level funding round. Our deck: https://www.slideshare.net/PavelCheshev1/timeflip-pitch-deck-feb-2019",

Peeki,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/peeki
"Peeki is an innovative startup born at the end of 2020 with the idea of ​​bringing the world of online and offline shopping together and working in synergy. What problem does it solve? A large number of purchases are concluded online due to lack of information: we did not know that the pair of trousers we were looking for, that particular size, was available in a shop in our city. Peeki promotes the purchase model that is called “ROPIS”: Reserve-Online-Purchase-In-Store. Through the proprietary marketplace it offers a service that allows: - The physical store to have a ""Plug & Play"" technological solution which operates on different levels of integration, capable of digitizing the warehouse, indexing products, making them visible and available online, in order to satisfy an highly geolocated users’ demand. Through the dashboard it is also possible to manage customer loyalty services such as discount and cashback campaigns, as well as the sale of gift vouchers. - The user has an online service which allows checking, in real time, the availability of products in the nearby stores, book the desired item, go directly to the store and decide whether to complete the purchase. What does it translate into? - saving of time and stress for the user due to continuous searches and phone calls. Buying in the store means trying and touching, no returns due to a wrong purchase. - economic support for commercial activities in the area - relationship of trust and loyalty that develops between customer and seller - makes it possible ""last minute"" purchase, which the e-commerce model cannot satisfy due to logistical reasons - benefit for the environment in terms of environmental impact resulting from CO2 equivalent emissions and packaging avoidance, as natural consequence of the drastic reduction in returns and reverse logistics (on average 1 out of 4 online fashion purchase is returned)",

Michael Jakobsen, Founder and CEO of RPAIR said: “As a team, we are really proud and excited to be launching RPAIR supporting an industry that two of our founder’s family have been a part of for over 30 years. Receiving the funds from Innovate UK is an amazing opportunity, it has given us the boost we need to launch and start supporting the industry we are so passionate about through these troubled times. The funds will be allocated to research and development of the platform ready for launch in December. “The pandemic has accelerated the need to digitise the quoting and booking process so that repair businesses can continue to trade in a world where traditional face-to-face contact is difficult. Innovation in this space will unlock a new, bigger, online customer base to the repair industry. Through building trust in reviews and making repair costs easier for customers to access we hope to stimulate the market by encouraging people to get those watch and jewellery items out of their draws and get them repaired, serviced, valued or made into something else they love.”",

Our marquee Platform is YAZTA, an on-demand marketplace that pairs up households with domestic help. Our next milestone is a seed round that will allow us to grow rapidly and improve User Engagement thanks to the Network Effect.

In contrast, we provide a straightforward mobile digital solution to this age-long LATAM pain point that is reliable and trustworthy for both sides. Yet another pain point that we solve, specific to SPs, is that they are regularly underpaid and taken advantage of. We are pretty far along on our way to turn YAZTA into the favorite option for anyone looking to get a decent-paying gig that earns them a living wage. Going forward, we intend to considerably increase the number of chores offered, as well as make communications and financial transactions seamless, reliable and safe.

Avyanna,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/avyanna
"Problem Why does Avyanna matter anyways? Our world today is a global village, albeit one with a heterogeneous population. With so many advancements in social media technology, people have never felt more alone than they do now. So how can we connect strangers from far and near? How do we make them friends? And how can we get these people to unify emotionally? Well, by motivating them when they ask for help. This is what Ayvanna stands for: ‘Making life beautiful and better for others’ The Solution We are all the same: unique, extraordinary and beautiful individuals—regardless of language, skin color or ideology. Ayvanna is not just a brand, it is a way of life; one which seeks to bring out the best in people by connecting them to others who share their problems. Avyanna is not just an online community; it is a hub of vibes and positivity. We want to become a beacon of light for everyone sinking into depression. This is who we are at Avyanna and what we offer the world. Achievements Avyanna has managed to keep a lot of freelancers employed. We also have arrays of quality clothing, as well as supplementary items with inspiring quotes to make people feel loved. In fact, locally, Avyanna has been fantastic. Combined with the number of emails gleaned from our international store, we are primed for top-notch email marketing outreaches. We have also added a software development company to the fold. They have promised us groundbreaking technology, which we cannot wait to share with the rest of the world. Why We Need Funding In just a few months, Avyanna has grown from just an ‘idea’ to a booming online community and a counterpart ecommerce store. The viability of Avyanna as a business is quite clear: we have survived our first year as a startup, and are continuing to expand in various segments of our establishment. When people ask, ‘What is Avyanna?’ we show them what it is; and (with sufficient financial support) what it could become: 1. Avyanna Stores: Presently, Avyanna has an online store selling beautiful printed t-shirts and accessories to people from all around the world. We also have a local Japanese store catering to a wide customer base. With funding: Avyanna could add more high quality stock such as shoes, bags, belts; basically all types of activewear for men and women constantly requested by our customers. There have also been requests for children wears from customers. With adequate funding, Avyanna could afford t-shirt printing machines and can begin mass production of these products; and open physical stores locally and internationally to attract even more customers. 2. Avyanna Tech: Yes, Avyanna is actively in the tech business as well. As aforementioned, we are in talk with software engineers to create a groundbreaking wireless speaker charger called ‘Dream’ Its prototype still being developed, the ‘Dream’ will solve the problem of bad Wi-Fi connectivity for many freelancers living in the suburbs. Possessing an array of next level tech features, this device is truly a game-changer. With funding: Avyanna could speed up the development of the Dream. Sooner than later, this next level speaker charger could be a plug and play device in hotels, offices, and homes worldwide. A tech like this needs little promotion; however, with adequate funding to back a creative marketing strategy, Avyanna can generate millions of money in sales solely with the sale of this product. 3. Avyanna Motivation Café: To support our online community, Avyanna is currently pursuing the construction of motivational cafes; a place where people can relive stress through food, drinks, music, as well as friendly and insightful discussions with others. We envision a café, open 24/7, which is cozy enough to be considered a second home to many customers. With funding: Leveraging on my previous experience as an Italian café owner, expanding Avyanna motivation café will not be a problem. With sufficient funding, we can build numerous cafes across the continent, increasing our customer base and sales in the process. Combined with our physical stores, we can build cafés in Japan and expand globally, as we gain recognition. Why Should You Invest in Avyanna? Avyanna, of course, has a direction; and it needs funding to achieve that. Your support, should we acquire it, will take Avyanna to the next level. With sufficient capital, we can assemble the best team, further our marketing endeavors, add new stock to our online store and upscale the business. In the next 2-3 years, we see: • Avyanna store becoming a global conglomerate both locally and internationally. • Avyanna motivational forum having 2 million+ active members, and maximizing its ad revenue; which is incredibly profitable. • Avyanna speaker-charger tech in the hands of millions of customers globally. • Avyanna motivation café becoming a ‘feel good’ hub for people from all over the world. Marketing Strategy I could fill up this section with numerous marketing possibilities, but you know, as well as I do, that anyone can create a marketing plan. One thing stands out for Avyanna however; and that is the fact that we have a strong brand—a brand people want to be a part of, for free. Head over to the Avyanna forum, and you’ll see hundreds of busy freelancers who take precious time, out of their busy schedule, to converse with each other. Head over to our YouTube channel, and you’ll see thousands upon thousands of views from people who instantly connect to our brand. Our brand is strong enough to compete in this niche industry. Avyanna has proved that, time and time again. Because of our strong branding, it doesn’t take much for Avyanna to convince top-class marketers and influencers to promote our products. Combine our brand strength with powerful promotion, and the possibilities of Avyanna cementing its place as a global hub of motivation becomes super apparent.",

"We are digitizing industries to create a better world. A world with new opportunities for people to evolve and enjoy their lives. A new way of working, investing, creating business and opportunities for all sectors. Let me tell you more about our work: Since the inception of blockchain, we have championed its application across all sectors as Codebooster. What started as an experiment that took place exclusively online is now changing industries and transforming the way they work forever. Blockchain technology was first introduced to the world in 2008. It is known as the technology behind cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin and Ethereum. But blockchain offers more. Much more. We believe blockchain can revolutionize data management by decentralizing information storage, increasing process efficiency and, at the same time, ensuring greater security for everything from IoT (Internet of Things) devices to health records, supply chains and even government agencies. That means we have another step to go. Let me give you an example about our work with this new vision: The cannabis industry's transition to using this revolutionary technology has benefited greatly from our work with them by making it possible to conduct transactions at low cost rather than the high cost and risk of using large amounts of cash. This works through a system where data is automatically shared across devices without any human intervention, ultimately leading to transparency within these markets no longer being compromised thanks in large part to their use of distributed ledger technology: the Orion Project, also known as WID Token, is our vision for this industry, and we are already working with our own cryptocurrency, its own payment gateway and DAPP marketplace. My company has been looking at getting rid of its old concept, because didn't reflect how far the technology had come since its inception. That's why we are rebranding, so the community can see us in a new light: a more modern take on how you all have been operating for years and now it's time to step up our game! We want to show the community that we are all in this together. We need each other's help, and there is no better way to show our gratitude than through a rebranding that reflects our new perspective of life as one big ecosystem, made up of industries (Constellations) and groups within each constellation, which reference different processes within the industry that need to be optimized or changed to increase the quality of life in our communities.

"BLYNE: Your Social AI Assistant for Meaningful Connections BLYNE is a pre-seed technology startup that aims to revolutionize social connections by leveraging scientific methods and AI to match individuals based on mental compatibility rather than age, gender, sexual orientation, or physical appearance. Loneliness has become a pressing issue in today's society, with dating apps and social media algorithms commodifying human connections and creating echo chambers. BLYNE addresses this problem with a unique ""matching"" application developed through extensive sociological research and state-of-the-art AI. Our innovative UX/UI design focuses on users' psychological perspectives and eliminates profile pages, swiping, photo uploads, and other superficial factors to facilitate connections with like-minded individuals across the globe. Upon entering our app, users meet BLYNE, a ChatGPT-4-like AI assistant trained to understand individuals' life stances and map their mindset. BLYNE initiates natural conversations with users and employs question patterns crafted by sociologists to learn about them and refine its understanding of their mindset over time. BLYNE connects people with similar mindsets by analyzing their life choices and identifying their stances on daily challenges and activities. As a social AI assistant, BLYNE goes beyond merely suggesting compatible matches among registered users, regardless of their age, gender, sexual orientation, or location. It also provides comprehensive reports detailing similarities and differences between matched individuals, monitors evolving mindsets, and offers ongoing feedback on personal changes. BLYNE is designed to revolutionize socialization by fostering accurate and meaningful connections and becoming the new standard for managing social interactions. With BLYNE, users can also ask questions about relationships, their social environment, and themselves, receiving comprehensive assistance across all aspects of social interactions. The AI assistant continues to pose in-depth questions to gauge compatibility and assists throughout the entire real-world interactions. BLYNE consistently measures the compatibility of couples, family members, close friends, and colleagues, providing insights, guidance, and regular reports on various relationships. For brands, BLYNE offers a premium AI-powered data analyst, enabling them to measure their customer base's thought and behavior structures through mental segmentation developed by our expert sociologists. This AI data assistant generates automated insights and predictive reports based on brand demand. To date, we have raised $200,000, assembled a team of sociologists, field-tested our methodology, initiated branding, and established a social media team. We have also begun developing the backend software in collaboration with our CTO. We are in the process of forming a company in the United States and Europe, where we plan to locate our operations. We believe BLYNE can disrupt socialization processes in the modern world and address loneliness, and we are seeking visionary investors to join our journey. In addition to funding, we are exploring partnerships with corporations experienced in business development, scaling, software development, and marketing.",

We are third-party logistics and we allow you the following things. Allows you to focus on critical operations. Rather than attempting to manage logistics on your own, outsource them to a company that has extensive understanding and experience in the field. Liability is reduced. Insurance certificates, safety ratings, and other important information are handled by logistics service providers across the full chain of interrelated contracts with carriers. They also frequently have people in the back office who can help with carrier verification, invoicing variations, and other issues. Back-office work has been reduced. Many 3PL outsourcing firms already have the necessary personnel and processes in place. As a result, they can process thousands of bills in a short time and properly audit them. Managing Petty Expenses Effectively Small costs like docking fees and transportation costs can be managed by logistics service providers. The logistic service providers handle the smallest expenses, allowing your accounting staff to focus on more important responsibilities. Customer satisfaction has improved. Logistics services are the focus of many service companies. They are experts in their field and offer cutting-edge solutions. Scale Economies of Scale are a type of scale economy. It's easy to spend a lot of money attempting to establish your own team to provide logistical services. Third-party logistics service providers, on the other hand, can assist in achieving economies of scale because they solely focus on logistics and can rapidly increase or decrease the number of services. Services we provide: We provide services like Truck Dispatch Services EDI, ELD/HOS, Update, IT Services, Finance Logistics Service, and Accounting. We work in the industries like All Vegetables and Fruits, Groceries Logistics, Steel Logistics, Meat Logistics, Grains and Seeds Logistics, Plastic, Products Logistics, Lumber Logistics, and Dairy Products Logistics.",

CaseLab,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/caselab
"CaseLab is the first task and project management tool on the market tailored for IT business transformations (ERP, CRM, WEB, BI). It brings all project work into one tool, so you have your coding in DevOps/Jira and EVERYTHING else in CaseLab - plans, tasks, history, estimates, time, customer dialogue, documentation. One tool to replace all the others your teams run projects in today (Excel, Outlook, SharePoint, MS Project). With our pre-delivered ERP/project templates it is much easier to run efficient and smooth projects. Create projects based on pre-setup, all including templates with best practice models, where all phases and tasks are ready to go. We call it “shake and bake projects”. Simply select a project start date and the system does all the planning for you. Easy, no matter your or your team's experience. You can also create and maintain your own project templates, so your delivery methods get better based on learnings for each project you run. WHY DOES THE ERP WORLD NEED ANOTHER PROJECT MANAGEMENT TOOL? When we worked as project managers and consultants, we spent a really long time forcing DevOps to fit in with fx D365, AX or SAP implementations. And we had to give up every time and realize that we could not set up and manage our projects in it, while people still ran most of the project work outside the system. We also realized that it is not a change management problem that our consultants and client users did not use the system - it was simply because it was built for something completely different than running ERP projects. We could not bear to face another long and painful attempt to get our consultants and clients to use DevOps, which in all cases always ended with each person having an individual process for solving their tasks (Excel, Outlook, SharePoint). And there was never an aligned ‘one way of working’ across our projects and customers, so our delivery methods could get better for each project we ran. Therefore we built CaseLab as the first tool on the market for managing ERP projects. For companies contemplating, purchasing or implementing a new ERP system, the project process must never be an obstacle or exhausting affair. Running an ERP project is complex but with DevOps/Jira for code/release/merge and CaseLab for everything else it becomes ten times easier.",

PulsAero,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/pulsaero
"PulsAero is a creative communication agency with a vision to help businesses of all sizes transform into a brand that delivers what the consumers need and expect. With an authentic, transparent, and unique approach, our quirky talent force comes together to create distinct verbal and visual realities that are most relevant for a brand in today’s times. A harmony between logic, creativity, and communication lies at the heart of PulsAero. This is not only our core philosophy but also the strategy that drives our talent in the direction of your brand and its people. In the unprecedented times when consumer mindset is changing, lifestyle is transforming, technology is evolving, there is immense pressure on businesses to rethink, reinvent and readjust. We integrate our trio into all your branding and brand marketing efforts to empower and retain your existing customers while attracting prospects. It all begins with out-of-the-box thinking, humanized communication, and personalized experiences for your target audience. 1. Branding: It is a one-off opportunity to build your brand personality, story, and promise for your audience. It determines the people you serve, how you make them feel, and how you deliver across all touchpoints. PulsAero, as a creative communication agency, offers one-of-its-kind SIIL services that help your business transform into a customer-favorite brand. We create a comprehensive brand strategy, identity, and launch solutions that are cohesive, scalable, and flexible in both the worlds — online and offline. More importantly, we ensure every public appearance your brand makes is welcomed and loved by your target audience and customers. a. Strategy: Many businesses across the world place foot in the marketplace without a clear brand strategy. Lack of vision, vague understanding of the consumer, focus only on customer acquisition, and growth pressures are a few of the major reasons behind the challenges. PulsAero introduces a unique concept of building a compelling brand strategy using Black Panther’s hunting strategy that shows the rarest attributes of unbreakable focus, powerful instincts, and piercing awareness. We won’t reveal more here as we ardently want you to explore the concept on our website! b. Identity: Are you sure your business doesn’t need a new brand identity system? Is your decision based on facts and figures? Whether you are starting a start-up or moving into the next decade of your business, there are three scenarios that signal companies to get ready for a new brand identity. It’s when your brand outgrows, when the industry outgrows or when the brand’s value declines amongst your customers. PulsAero creative agency designs brand identity systems that are easily recognizable, recallable, and reminiscent of Peacock’s identity. Using the concept we ensure your brand establishes a lasting connection with your audience. c. Interface: Big names including Airbnb, Apple, Google, Mint, and Uber owe much of their success to their user-focused design approach. Despite operating in the same domain, many businesses fail to deliver a great user experience to their audience. Ignoring user experience testing, unclear user journeys, and non-inclusive UI UX design are a few causes behind it. Hence gaining insights from Spider’s intrinsic spinning capabilities, we develop intuitive and user-centric interfaces to help your brand thrive in the digital world. Plus, we offer Webflow website design and development services as Webflow is headed to become the future of websites! d. Launch: Launching a brand or product without identifying the right target audience and understanding consumer behavior altogether results in failed launch campaigns. Companies commit such mistakes as there is a lack of a powerful brand launch strategy, wrong brand positioning, and unclear brand messaging. But Horse can help you win the race! We learn from the animal’s capability to endure unforeseen hurdles, gain momentum and win the competition in the market. 2. Brand Marketing: It is a continuous effort of keeping up with the promise you made, regularly. It ensures you are striking harmonious chords with people’s passion. Brand marketing goes way beyond in reaching your target audience in building meaningful relationships. It is unlike direct marketing done by internet marketing services to achieve short-term sales goals. We do not help companies do ‘business as usual.’ Instead, we unlock your brand superpower by applying ‘alternate reality’ that a marketing genius loves! a. Brand Management: Your business is facing a brand management problem. It needs to connect with the customers on a deeper, more emotional level. However, poor understanding of your consumer, lack of empathy, unreal celebrity endorsements among other factors forms the roadblock. At PulsAero, we apply a new system that helps you in enhancing your brand awareness and ultimately increasing brand loyalty. b. Content Marketing: No matter the size, many companies fail to generate leads despite putting the best efforts into content creation and content distribution. A lot of factors including lack of human-focused content, long-term thinking, clarity, consistency, and extra focus on creating viral content prove to be the barriers. We solve your problem by focusing on the driving factors and move ahead with a content marketing strategy that is structured, organized, consistent with a systematic execution. We don’t stop here! We measure the performance and optimize the efforts respectively. c. Social Media Marketing: A truckload of content is published on social media. Yet your brand engagement remains low. It indicates the need to develop an authentic social media strategy. It calls for detailed research to understand your audience, to take a platform-specific approach, and be consistent in the execution. PulsAero offers channel-specific social media marketing services that focus on cohesive, transparent, and authentic brand messaging. It not just accelerates brand engagement but also results in B2B and B2C lead generation. Last but not least, we conduct social media monitoring which is key to determining future strategy. d. Ad Campaign Management: Many companies keep rolling out an infinite number of advertising campaigns without an in-depth study of the target audience. Their efforts are focused on acquiring customers rather than taking care of the existing customers. Traditional marketing methods, lack of optimization, and the absence of a test-and-learn mindset leads to poor performance of the advertising campaigns. We help brands embrace the all-new loyalty ladder concept of the marketing legend Marty Neumeier that first pays attention to empowering the existing customers. This not only helps your brand in creating the deepest level of emotional attachment but also makes customer acquisition more budget-friendly and efficient. We begin with the end goal in mind. We identify the budget, choose the right platform for launch, optimize the finances — and continue monitoring the performance.",

ebazaar.ge,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/ebazaar-ge
"ebazaar.ge is the first online platform in Georgia that is changing the way how farmers present and sell their farm produce. At ebazaar.ge our mission is to provide our partner farmers with a digital sales channel and operational support in order for them to be able to sell their products on a state-of-the-art digital marketplace and reach thousands of customers remotely. The digitized process of listing farmers on the digital market, giving them unlimited space for their products, and the ability to reach all types of consumers – individuals and corporations thru the digital channels, creates a unique innovation tool facilitating market linkages. PROBLEM DOMAIN Seller Problem Domain In the world of 2022, when the pandemic period has forced all types of businesses to go online and make products available for remote purchase, the agricultural sector in Georgia is in no hurry to digitalize its presence. More than that, almost 90% of the regional households and farms have no direct access to the big markets in Georgia and have zero possibility to have any touch with the final customer in terms of receiving any feedback or feeling the market needs. Instead, according to the current flow, agricultural products are mostly sold in bulk at very low prices to 2-3 intermediaries who sell further, until the products reach the final consumer. Buyer Problem Domain less regulated import of agricultural products and increased social awareness of the importance of healthy food drove social attention to the local farm products. At this point, many residents of the large cities turn to their relatives in the regions in search of reliable producers of agricultural products. This is also consistent with Georgian legislation - a local farmer isn't allowed to harvest genetically modified products, but the import of such products from other countries is not prohibited. SOLUTION DOMAIN Ebazaar.ge – Digital Farmer’s Marketplace For farmers and households ebazaar.ge creates named digital counters, so the Farmers are easily identified and have the opportunity to place and sell an unlimited number of products. Farmers are also provided with an operational admin panel, equipped with product lists, order receiving, and customer feedback functionality. Each farmer has an assigned regional employee, who coaches farmers in digital sales and helps them prepare sold products for shipping. For the customer ebazaar.ge is a mobile responsive, easy purchase flow platform, where the customer simply finds desired products from desired farmers and regions, and receives them the next day at their doorstep.",

Matt Riches Search Marketing,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/matt-riches-search-marketing
"Whether we are talking about small local businesses or larger corporations that provide goods or services in some form or another, they all have one thing in common … they need quality leads to thrive and survive. Of course there are many different avenues for lead acquisition, some providing a better quality of lead and some providing a better ROI than others. For the most part, word of mouth referrals are the highest converting lead source as they come pre-loaded with a quality review from a previous client. They also provide fantastic return on investment as they cost absolutely nothing. The only problem with getting hundreds or thousands of word of mouth referrals is you need to aquire the customer base, before you have get the benefits of continuous customer referrals. In 2019, most of you business owners taking the time to read my content will realize that there is a huge opportunity for lead growth using various digital marketing channels and strategies. All the effective strategies are going to cost you money in some form or another, weather it be through professional content writing, cost per click leads, social media ads, Search Engine Optimization (SEO) and the list goes on. Trying to run any paid leads campaign without any knowledge of what you are doing will undoubtedly lead to thousands of wasted dollars and time lost. Getting a return on investment for a paid ads strategy takes many hours of research and planning, deep level understanding of your audience, many hours of set up, many monthly hours of continuous monitoring and tweaking, landing page conversion rate optimization and a lot of properly directed effort. The good news is it can be done, and I have been doing it very effectively week in and week out for my clients for the past eight years. If you think your in need of these types of services, continue reading below. WHO DO I WORK WITH? In all the time I have been dealing with different business owners, I can definitely tell you the ones that become successful have a much more realistic expectation of the work that is required. They are dedicated to lead tracking and record keeping, they are dedicated to self improvement and building a growth mindset, they are dedicated to continuous improvement on all business processes including sales, communication, systems, customer interactions and data analysis. Most of all, they are all willing to accept some risk and devote time and capital in the interests of scaling their business. The truth is, the only people that I will work with is those who fit the mindset of the business owner described above, and the reality is these are the only people I will be able to effectively help anyway. You see when a full digital marketing campaign is in full swing, the only thing that really matters is the ROI on the leads. The only way we will know if we are are getting a return on investment is if you and your team are tracking the data correctly. You really must understand that the data we collect from our lead systems (SEO, Google ads, Google maps business page and social media ads), is what will give you the business owner the confidence scale rapidly. I have been directly involved in the rapid expansion of several business and I can apply these same digital marketing strategies to yours. To go further into detail, it is not just data collection I need from you. In many cases I will need streams of fresh business specific images for use on our landing pages and other web media. I will regularly contact you for discussions about the specifics of your services and the way you implement them. I will give suggestions and recommendations about ways to streamline our search marketing campaigns inline with your current business processes. In the first 6-12 months we will probably talk on the phone at least once per week. If you have resistance to any this you will probably hold me up by not giving me what I need. If you are not scared off yet, there is a good chance we will make a great digital marketing partnership… so keep reading. WHO AM I? Born and bred in the small coastal town of Moruya on the NSW far south coast, I am probably more of a country boy at heart but spent my whole adult life in the city. I am 37 years old, a father, an outdoors-man, a sportsman, a teacher, a broad thinker, a traveler, a hard worker and a former soldier. I have always enjoyed both physical and mental challenges, and I am at my happiest when I am learning something new and achieving a desirable result. HOW DID I GET INTO DIGITAL MARKETING? Back in 2010, late 20’s, I had just spent the last 4 years of my life travelling and working in some of the well known resort destinations around Queensland. After spending a brief period between jobs, I got to thinking about the path ahead as most of us do, and realized my value system really resonated with not having to be tied to one work location or vocation and this lead me on the path to making money online. A path which I am sure many of you have also sort after. It wasn't until 2011 where I took an interest in website design, where i initially thought I could just make money by making websites for business owners. Not long after I started doing this, It became apparent to me that a website is just a dead fish in the water, and holds no value to anyone without traffic. Ultimately, it was the path to understanding how to generate web traffic and understanding how people search for services online, that allowed me to see the bigger picture, and tie all the critical components together in an effective way. Knowing which digital assets to focus on drastically reduces the amount of wasted time on testing and gives me the ability to generate volumes of leads faster than my competitors can. Still Here … Fantastic! .. You are now qualified to read some of the more specific details on how to go about working with me, my goals and what you should expect from my search marketing services. Click the button below Ok Great, now that ive got your attention…. I am assuming everyone reading this page has already read my introduction on the homepage. If you have not, please go back and read it before we continue. MY GOALS My goal is to give you the business owner a platform where you can completely take your hands off just about every digital aspect of the business, so you can focus on growth and scale. This is a big advantage over having several agencies manage your various digital assets. Furthermore, any questions or issues you have can be resolved immediately by picking up the phone and calling me directly. You will never speak with anyone else besides me and I can answer any technical question you have on the spot. I say to all my clients before we first get started that you should not look at me like a disposable contractor, but much rather a stable long term employee of the business, that gets paid on ROI. I am not looking for ‘Churn and Burn’ style relationships which some of you may have experienced at other digital agencies in the past. WHEN YOU CONTACT ME Firstly, I need to understand your business and processes well enough to know that my services will be a good fit, and can realistically bring a quality return on investment. I also need to get an idea that you are someone with a growth mindset, and that you have enough drive to implement the processes I ask you to, and provide me with all the resources I need. After we chat on the phone, I will likely need more time to research the nature of your target audience, the dominate keywords and the competition we face before I can come back to you with a proposal. As for contracts, there arnt any. I will only take you onboard if I know I can generate a ROI. This is all the reason you will need to hang around.",

World's Greatest Pubs,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/world-s-greatest-pubs
"Alex Cordero spent 10 year building one of Ireland’s best known pub brands, Slatterys Pub D4 (It's known as a Mecca for Sport). He has built a platform which allows pubs to SELL their best tables to best customers. He has a modern fully fledged platform with all the bells and whistles and which allows many ecosystems to develop within the platform. The service is FREE to pubs and is B2B. Alex also created the World's Greatest Pubs & Clubs which is organising the 1st Rugby Pub World Cup sponsored by The Irish Post (largest Global Diaspora Newspaper and Social Media Site). Alex has self funded this from own funds and selling the ""Altra"" platform to a different industry. This revenue is helping to fund the ""Soft Launch"" planned for the Rugby World Cup. WGP will have 100 of the Top Rugby Pubs who qualified from 1,200 Rugby pubs across 6 continents, 36 countries and 110 cities. This means for each week of the RWC19 there will be a 100 pubs selling their best tables online which Tabla making 10% from each sale. Avg Table Price is €100 (it inlcudes €100 Pre-Paid Bar Tab). (15 pubs in 85 to go) The platform that grows organically and has almost zero cost structure. Revenues are from a 10% trasaction fee on the Tables purchased by the consumer. These tables are the best tables in a pub and come with 5 to 6 chairs and an agreed pre-pid bar tab i.e. €100 A very simple idea built on top class tech which was 1st unleased in Slatterys D4 during the RWC2015 but it has taken Alex 4 years to make it Zero Cost, Zero Time to Implement and Zero Training required for the Pub. But a lifetime to enjoy for Pub owners, managers, workers, customers and suppliers. Why is Tabla sports?... we don't sell beer... we sell atmosphere. RWC15; 51,000 live at each game on avg, 8.7m watched each game on TV on avg. How many watched it in a decent boozer? 1m or 2m? Why can't we guanratee our tables? Systemised Pub, Performer & Promoter ecosystems delivered. Our platform enables pubs and clubs to SELL their best tables to the best customers. Fan Engagement: ""Imagine guaranteeing great tables in great pubs for the best nights with your best mates"" ""Imagine organising an event for your clients to watch the biggest games in te greatest pubs and guaranteeing them absolute service"" Broadcast & Media: ""Imagine promoting a product everyone loves - a guaranteed good night out with their best friends- and generating an income from it"" ""Imagine a whole industry who cannot sell their best assets online... suddenly able to"" ""We help pubs SELL tables... beware it's addictive"" Sponsorship ""10% of our revenues are going to ARC Cancer Services"" ""Each an every Pub or Merchant can if they desire allocate an agreed % to a local charity which leads to micro sponsorship ecosystems all over the globe"" ""Imagine pub owners, performers and bloggers working together to maximise their venues with no financial risk to putting on events"" We allow pubs to sell their tables - not book or reserve them - SELL them. This creates data that is used to rank our members across genres on a global scale. We are following a Blue Ocean Strategy. Tabla is for the top 20% of pubs and what offer is Ranking as a Service ( RaaS) which is delivered by the Tabla Platform. This means that our Pubs (The World’s Greatest Pubs) are ranked 1 to 1000 in each genre Rugby, Live Music etc. The rankings are data driven - totally objective and so like golf or tennis a pub will know why they are say 560th and what they need to do to get into the top 500. What Tabla also does is show how as they progress they make more money. This is a philosophy from the Sporting World, Progress over Profit - Profit is a by product of Progress. We also have Tab-Link and Tab-White. Tab-link is for the next 20% of pubs/clubs. Same functionality but no ranking. Tab-white is a white labeling solution for Pub Chains. Takes out all the risk and cost but gives them all the functionality, own brand and revenue growth. While the concept was first delivered in August 2015 it took Alex 4 years to find a solution that was scalable to 10,000 Pubs. His wife has built a business delivering a pre-cursor to pubs and restaurants. But Alex wanted something to change the World of Pubs. - Research project Greyhound Office 6 months - Development of Product Project May 1st 2019 - Move into Talent Garden Office and Purchase of One-Zero ticket June 1st - Development or Route to Market Strategy July 20th - setting up of WGP www.worldsgreatestpubs.com and #PRWC19 initiative (full Social media setup FB, TW, INST, GSUITE, WEB) - Sponsor Signed up The Irish Post Aug 1st 2019 - Alan Quinlan (Rugby Rep for #RPWC & Arc House Charity Agreements - Sale of platform software services to a different industry ""Altra"" - secured funding to carry on Tabla - Development of Global #RPWC19 Qualifying form and global launch via @theirishpost Aug 15th 2019 - 1st live broadcast with 1st 5 Rugby Pub Qualifiers during half time of Sco v Fra friendly Sat 24th Aug.

Teal Marketing Inc,https://www.crunchbase.com/organization/teal-marketing-inc
"Since Teal Marketing Inc was founded, we have created a reputation for ourselves in Knoxville as a results-driven, service-based business. We blend state of the art CRM software, the best talent in Tennessee, and proven communication strategies aimed at acquiring retail-based consumers. In short, we’ve created a business model based on serving others, whether that be our clients, their customers, or our team…and we do it with pride. We haven’t revolutionized the way corporations attract new customers — we just do it in a more efficient, cost-effective, timely manner. The executive team at Teal Marketing Inc has created a niche in 4 areas: Sales Consulting, Direct Marketing, Customer Acquisition, and Management Training. Though they may each sound different, the concepts are all intertwined and feed into one another. Marketing a product face to face generates a sale. Sales acquire new customers, and systematic training processes generate the expertise our client wants managing new office locations. All of Teal Marketing Inc's services are managed personally and locally, rather than through mass marketing efforts. We come into each customer interaction well-educated and with a solution in mind, taking the time to understand the unique needs of each individual customer. Our interactions, in a retail-based setting, ensure our clients receive the visibility they seek and the amount of market growth they desire. Furthermore, our ability to start, and build and retain relationships within the Knoxville community make our services truly unparalleled!",
